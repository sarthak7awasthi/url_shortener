# url_shortener

This is a web application which allows users to enter different urls, and the site returns a short version of those urls. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Node.js and MongoDB
You can download and find the instructions to install them through these links:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Installing
To install the other necessary packages: 
* Navigate to the repository on your terminal
* Install all other dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the project and using the app

* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal, 
* Then run the flask server:
```bash
nodemon server.js
```
* Open any browser and go to localhost:5000/

## Future of the project

The future of the application involves hosting the project and using mongo cloud service. I plan to add an expiry system so that the short urls will expire after their use.
